# Website Purpose & Core Experience

Goal: Help users eat smarter with personalized meal planning, clear nutrition guidance, and flexibility—without making food feel restrictive.

# What Makes NutriPlan Stand Out

## 1) Truly Personalized From Day One

● Smart onboarding adapts meals to your body, goals, lifestyle, and preferences

● No generic diets — plans change based on activity level, goals, and food choices

● Allergies and restrictions are handled safely and automatically

## 2. Eat Better Without Feeling Restricted

● Flexible meal swaps whenever you want

● Choice between same meals or daily variety

## 3. Clear Nutrition, Zero Confusion

● Calories & protein shown clearly on every meal

● Visual macro charts instead of boring numbers

● Simple guidance like “You’re in the green zone today”

## 4. AI That Feels Like a Friendly Coach 🤖

Ask natural questions:

● “Suggest a high-protein dinner”

● “Why am I missing my protein goal?”

● AI explains why, not just what

● Supportive, non-judgmental tone

● Ingredients pulled directly from your meal plan

● Organized by category

● Check off what you already have

● Downloadable PDF for easy shopping

## 8. Meal-by-Meal Control

● Swap, lock, or improve meals individually

## 9. Built-In Motivation & Gamification 🎯

● Streaks for consistency

● Points for logging meals
